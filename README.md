# GeoFIK: A fast and reliable geometric IK solver for the Franka arm

**GeoFIK** (**Geo**metric **F**ranka **IK**) is an analytical geometric solver for the inverse kinematics (IK) of the Franka arm. GeoFIK has the following advantages over other solvers:
* GeoFIK is ultra fast! It is an analytical solver, so the computational time is in the order of tens of microseconds on standard laptops. This is much faster than numerical solvers and, according to our experiments, also faster than the algebraic analytical solvers generated by IKFast.
* Unlike other analytical solvers, GeoFIK provides four different ways to resolve the 1-DOF redundancy of the Franka arm. Functions that solve the IK using $$q\_7$$, $$q\_6$$, $$q\_4$$ or the swivel angle as free variables are provided. 
* Before computing the joint angles, GeoFIK finds the entire geometry of the arm by calculating the screw axes of the joints. Hence, the Jacobian matrices for each IK solution are returned at no significan extra computational cost.
* Due to its geometric nature, all possible solutions for the IK problem with redundancy solved are found. We proved that the maximum number is 8. Joint limits are checked before returning the solutions.
* All singularities are detected and handled efficiently using screw theory. The user can provide emergency values of joint angles to resolve the singularity.

For detailed information about the implementation, tests and experiments, see the preprint of our paper [arXiv:2503.03992v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03992v1).

## Requirements

This version has been tested with GCC compiler for C++ 17. The functions use the Eigen library which can be downloaded [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org). This version was tested with Eigen 3.4.0.

## Usage

### World and end-effector frames

GeoFIK uses frame $$E$$ as end-effector frame, and frame $$O$$ as world frame, as shown in the picture below. In [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) $$E$$ and $$O$$ are named `panda_hand_tcp` and `panda_link0`, respectively. 

![frames of the franka arm](frames.png) 

Some applications, especially when the gripper is removed, may use the flage frame 8 (`panda_link8`) also called $$F$$ as end-effector frame. The transformation between this frame and frame $$E$$ is shown in the figure above and can be represented by the following transformation matrix $${}^{8}\_{E}$$ùêì: 
```
T8E = [[ 0.70710678  0.70710678  0.          0.        ]
       [-0.70710678  0.70710678  0.          0.        ]
       [ 0.          0.          1.          0.1034    ]
       [ 0.          0.          0.          1.       ]]
```
Therefore, when working with frame 8, given a desired pose $${}^{O}\_{8}$$ùêì, the solver must be called with $${}^{O}\_{E}$$ùêì = $${}^{O}\_{8}$$ùêì $${}^{8}\_{E}$$ùêì.

### Functions provided

**Functions that only calculate joint angles**

All functions return the number of solutions found as an `unsigned int`. 8 solutions for joint angles are stored in an array `qsols` which is passed by reference by the caller. If a solution does not exist `nan` is assigned to all the entries of the corresponding row. If a joint angle is outside the joint limits in a found solution, `nan` is assigned to the joint angle.

**Functions that calculate joint angles and Jacobian matrices**

The following functions include the optional parameter `Jacobian_ee` which allows to specify an end-effector frame for the Jacobian. Note that this can be different to the end-effector frame of the IK which is _always_ $$E$$. When working with frames $$F$$, $$8$$ or $$6$$, this parameter allows the user to get the Jacobian in the desired frame without having to transform it manually, saving computational time.

## Examples

The file `example_geofik.cpp` shows how to import GeoFIK, and how to call each of the solvers with case examples. For the fastest results, it is recommended to compile with optimization level 3, using a GCC compiler:
```
g++ example_geofik.cpp geofik.cpp -O3 -o example_geofik.exe
```

### Minimal example:

Consider the IK problem with end-effector position and orientation given by $${}^{O}\_{E}$$ùêì:

```
TOE = [[ 0.3522750000000002  0.8334980991082203  0.4256560000000001 -0.26617644]
       [-0.6332361000000003 -0.12262271641620001 0.764183            0.31984145]
       [ 0.6891402000000002 -0.5387433117066003  0.48460420000000004 0.76295964]
       [ 0.                  0.                  0.                  1.       ]]
```

and a desired value for the fourth joint angle $$q\_4$$ = -2.3402. Then, the following code calls the solver and saves the solutions in the `qsols` array:

```
unsigned int nsols; 
array<double, 9> ROE = { 0.3522750000000002, 0.8334980991082203, 0.4256560000000001,
                        -0.6332361000000003, -0.12262271641620001, 0.764183,
                         0.6891402000000002, -0.5387433117066003, 0.48460420000000004 };
array<double, 3> r = { -0.26617644,0.31984145,0.76295964 };
double q4 = -2.3402;
array<array<double, 7>, 8> qsols;
nsols = franka_ik_q4(r, ROE, q4, qsols);
```

The result is stored in `qsols`. `nan` is assigned to joint angles that are outside the joint limits, and to entire solutions that cannot be assamblied.
