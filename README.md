# GeoFIK: A fast and reliable geometric IK solver for the Franka arm

**GeoFIK** (**Geo**metric **F**ranka **IK**) is an analytical geometric solver for the inverse kinematics (IK) of the Franka arm. GeoFIK has the following advantages over other solvers:
* GeoFIK is ultra fast! It is an analytical solver, so the computational time in the order of tens of microseconds on standard laptops. This is much faster than numerical solvers and, according to our experiments, also faster than the algebraic analytical solvers generated by IKFast.
* Unlike other analytical solvers, GeoFIK provides four different ways to resolve the 1-DOF redundancy of the Franka arm. Functions that solve the IK using q7, q6, q4 or the swivel angle as free variables are provided. 
* Before computing the joint angles, GeoFIK finds the entire geometry of the arm by calculating the screw axes of the joints. Hence, the Jacobian matrices for each IK solution are returned at no significan extra computational cost.
* Due to its geometric nature, all possible solutions for the IK problem are found. We proved that the maximum numer is 8. Joint limits are checked before returning the solutions.
* All singularities are detected and handled efficiently. The user can provide emergency values of joint angles to resolve the singularity.

For detailed information about the implementation, tests and experiments, see the preprint of our paper [arXiv:2503.03992v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03992v1).

## Usage

### World and end-effector frames

GeoFIK uses frame $$E$$ as end-effector frame, and frame $$O$$ as world frame, as shown in the picture below. In [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) $$E$$ and $$O$$ are named `panda_hand_tcp` and `panda_link0`, respectively.

Some applications, especially when the gripper is removed, may use the flage frame 8 (`panda_link8_sc`) also called $$F$$ as end-effector frame. The transformation between this frame and frame $$E$$ is shown in the figure above and can be represented by the following transformation matrix $${}^{8}\_{E}$$ùêì: 
```
T8E = [[ 0.70710678  0.70710678  0.          0.        ]
       [-0.70710678  0.70710678  0.          0.        ]
       [ 0.          0.          1.          0.1034    ]
       [ 0.          0.          0.          1.       ]]
```
Therefore, when working with frame 8, given a desired pose, $${}^{O}\_{8}$$ùêì, the solver must be called with $${}^{O}\_{E}$$ùêì = $${}^{O}\_{8}$$ùêì $${}^{8}\_{E}$$ùêì.

### Functions provided

These parameters are required by all functions:
* `r` position of frame $$E$$ in world frame $$O$$.
* `ROE` rotation matrix of frame $$E$$ with respect to frame $$O$$ (row-first format).
* `qsols` array to store 8 solutions.
* `q1_sing` [optional] emergency value of q1 in case of singularity at shoulder joints (type-1 singularity in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03992v1))

All functions return the number of solutions found as an `unsigned int`.

Solves the IK with the swivel angle as free variable, generates joint angles of solutions. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03992v1) for the geometric definition of swivel angle used here. This is a numerical algorithm as no closed-form solution exists. However, since the solver only uses the strictly necessary geometric information in each iteration, the computational times on standard laptops range in the few hundreds of microseconds.
 * theta     swivel angle in radians (see paper for geometric defninition)
 * n_points  [optional] number of points to discretise the range of q7.

**Functions that only calculate joint angles and Jacobian matrices**

In addition to `r`, `ROE`, `qsols` and `q1_sing`, all the following functions require these parameters:
* `r` position of frame $$E$$ in world frame $$O$$.
* `joint_angles` [optional] if false only Jacobians are returned.
* `Jacobian_ee` [optional] end-effector frame of the Jacobian ('E', 'F', '8' or '6'). This can be different to the end-effector frame of the IK which is _always_ $$E$$. When working with frames $$F$$, $$8$$ or $$6$$, this parameter allows the user to get the Jacobian in the desired frame without having to transform it manually, saving computational time.
