# GeoFIK: A fast and reliable gemetric IK solver for the Franka arm

**GeoFIK** (**Geo**metric **F**ranka **IK**) is an analytic geometric solver for the inverse kinematics (IK) of the Franka arm. GeoFIK has the following advantages over other solvers:
* GeoFIK is ultra fast. It is an analytical solver, so the computational time in the order of tens of microseconds on standard laptops. This is much faster than numerical solvers and, according to our experiments, also faster than the analytical solvers generated by IKFast.
* Unlike other analytical solvers, GeoFIK provides four different ways to resolve the 1-DOF redundancy of the Franka arm by providing q7, q6, q4 or the swivel angle as free variables in the IK problem. 
* Before computing the joint angles, GeoFIK finds the entire geometry of the arm by calculating the screw axes of the joints. Hence, the Jacobian matrices for each IK solution are returned at no significan extra computational cost.
* Due to its geometric nature, all possible solutions for the IK problem are found. We proved that the maximum numer is 8.
